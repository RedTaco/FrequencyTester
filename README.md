# FrequencyTester
A web scrapper that gives words with high frequencies 
Before returning a frequency it removes a list of words that are in "list.csv"
Works on most sites however requires some tweaking from user end
in Line 8 in either File you must insert the the URL
Line 21 you may have to change the HTML tag it looks for. Most sites have a div so just change the name of the id/Class.

Uga tester includes a bonus feature that uses a TTS engine to read the speech once the extra words have been cut from the text.
